Blogtools.py is called blogtools.py because that was a convenient name for the file, which pretty much summarises my approach to this project.

Blogtools is a Python module and a couple of scripts which turns Markdown-formatted plain text files into a reverse chronological ordered sequence of web pages (a "blog") by way of some templates and a 100% SQL-free moderately human-readable post list.

It's really more of a hobby project than anything else, I'd advise against trying to use it for anything resembling a real website.
